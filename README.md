Ichimoku modeling program with Pinescript

Ichimoku Kinko Hyo, or simply Ichimoku, is a Japanese technical indicator developed by Goichi Hosoda in the 1930s. It is exceptional because it provides a comprehensive market analysis at a glance, integrating trend, momentum, and support/resistance levels.

It consists of several components:

Tenkan-Sen (Conversion Line): The average of the highest highs and lowest lows over a short period.
Kijun-Sen (Base Line): A longer-period average that serves as a trend benchmark.
Senkou Span A & B (Kumo Cloud): Defines a dynamic support/resistance zone and helps visualize trend strength.
Chikou Span (Lagging Line): Confirms trend strength by comparing the current price to past prices.
This indicator is exceptional because, unlike other static price analysis tools (moving averages, RSI, etc.), it anticipates potential reversals and identifies strong trends with greater clarity.

Karen PÃ©loille is a leading expert on Ichimoku, having written several books and articles detailing its effectiveness. Her work highlights the power of this indicator for trading across various markets (stocks, forex, crypto, etc.).

I have developed a program that models Ichimoku, enabling automated visualization and optimized analysis of its signals.
